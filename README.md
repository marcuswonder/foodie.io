# Foodie.io
A place to collate and share your favourite recipes

<br>

## The vision for Foodie.io
I have always wanted somewhere to collect, collate and share recipes in a way that is both standardised and fun. Nowadays we get recipes from so many different places - established food publications, bloggers and Instagram (just to name a few), that it can be a challenge to keep track of them all. 

My vision for foodie.io is that it will be the place for all those publishers to come and share their recipes. Users can upload their own recipes, whilst browsing others, to form collections of their favourites. These collections can then be browsed by or shared with their friends, and printed as real-world collections or gifts using one of our standard templates.

Imagine this: you're on a beautiful holiday in Greece and youa are loving the food - but you don't know what to make or how to do it. Search the app for the meal you just ate, find some recipes and save them to your 'Greece' collection. When you get home, you explore similar recipes and over time curate a list of 12 favourite Greek recipes.

The holidays come, and you want to share a personal gift that will mean a lot to your friends: print them your Greece recipe collection!

A percentage of all books sold would be returned to the content creator!

## A summary of the project so far
I have created two data object models - recipes and collections. There is a one-many relationship between authors and their recipes and collections. Recipes and collections share a many-many relationship. 

I have managed to perform CRUD functions on all the following data objects:
<ul>
    <li> Recipes
    <li> Ingredients
    <li> Instructions
    <li> Collections
</ul>

In addition, I have been able to create and delete referential relationships between Ingredients and Collections.
